# MyCustomWatch
I have always wanted a custom smart watch, one I can fully control, and here it is! It has all the basics down, but still has room for improvement.

## How it works

This software will work with any GPS module, connect the modules's TX to IO17, and it's RX to 16. Furthermore, connect a 1.28 inch Round Display, and wire it up how the manufacturer like, and according to that configure tft_config.py
